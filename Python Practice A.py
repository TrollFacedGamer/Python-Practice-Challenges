Create a set of code that completes the following requirements:        A

The system should select a random number between 0-100.
The user should be able to guess four times, before revealing the answer.
The system should tell you if the guess is higher or lower than the actual number.,
Reminder: Insert comments, both a multi-line before the code and in-line comments.
